Implementation of [GroupRegNet: A Groupwise One-shot Deep Learning-based 4D Image Registration Method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/abd956).

GroupRegNet is an unsupervised deep learning-based DIR method that employs both groupwise registration and one-shot strategy to register 4D medical images and then to determine all pairwise deformation vector fields (DVFs). 

## Requirement

- PyTorch
- SimpleITK: read mhd files
- logging and tqdm

## Required Data

To evaluate GroupRegNet with `registration_dirlab.py`, the [DIR-Lab](https://www.dir-lab.com/index.html) dataset is required. The original data needs to be converted into mhd format.

Comparison of the tracked targets in ten phases by GroupRegNet and manual contouring of case 1 and 3. The images are shown in coronal views, and the horizontal line in each figure is at the same height for visual reference.
